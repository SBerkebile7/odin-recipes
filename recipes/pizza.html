    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When you use pickles with your food, you might top a burger, stuff them in a sandwich, or toss them in a salad. When you imagine a pizza, you think of gooey, delicious cheese and rich sauce, like a truffle or cream-based white sauce or a fragrant marinara, with classic toppings of cheese, meat, olives, and vegetables. What you don't think of? Putting pickles on top of that beautiful slice of pizza.</p>
    <p>You might recoil in disgust now, but pickle pizza is quickly becoming a common sight on pizza restaurant menus. In fact, you can even order a pickle pizza straight to your door.</p>
    <p>So where did this pickle pizza craze start? A few years ago, a pizza place called QC Pizza in Mahtomedi, Minn., created a pizza with dill pickles on it as a topping. It went viral, as crazy food combinations often do. Called the Kinda Big Dill Pizza, the pie got tons of attention, with more than 16 million views on Facebook.</p>
    <p>The Kinda Big Dill Pizza is based on the idea of Minnesota Sushi, a snack of cream cheese spread over a dill pickle, then wrapped in ham and sliced similarly to what you'd do with a sushi roll.</p>
